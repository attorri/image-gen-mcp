## Key Best Practices for GPT-Image-1 Prompts

### Be Specific and Detailed
The more specific your prompt, the better the image quality. Include details like the setting, objects, colors, mood, and any specific elements you want in the image. Avoid vague descriptions and instead provide rich, detailed context.

### Describe Mood and Atmosphere
Describe the mood or atmosphere you want to create in your image. This helps the AI understand the emotional tone and visual feeling you're aiming for.

### Use Clear, Unambiguous Language
Ensure your prompts are clear, specific, and provide enough context for the model to understand what you are asking. Avoid ambiguity and be as precise as possible to get accurate and relevant responses.

### Style Mixing and Enhancement
Try mixing styles! For example: "Cyberpunk claymation robot cat" or "Fantasy watercolor forest with origami animals" You can also use "high detail" or "ultra-realistic" if you want sharper results.

### Structure Your Prompts Effectively
Consider including these elements in your prompts:
- **Subject**: What is the main focus of the image?
- **Setting/Environment**: Where is the scene taking place?
- **Style/Art medium**: Photography, painting, digital art, etc.
- **Lighting**: Natural light, dramatic lighting, soft lighting
- **Color palette**: Specific colors or color schemes
- **Composition**: Close-up, wide shot, bird's eye view
- **Mood/Atmosphere**: Serene, dramatic, mysterious, cheerful

### Format and Dimensions
Note that gpt-image-1 typically generates square images (1024x1024 pixels). While you can't specify exact pixel dimensions, you can hint at the desired aspect ratio by including it in your prompt in a descriptive way, such as requesting "vertical poster format" or "landscape orientation."

### Quality Enhancement Tips
- Start with strong, centered subjects for better composition
- Include specific artistic styles or techniques
- Use descriptive adjectives for texture, lighting, and detail level
- Consider the emotional impact you want to create

The key is to be both creative and precise, giving the AI enough context to understand your vision while leaving room for its creative interpretation.
