# Drawing-Style Image Generation Features

## Current Implementation

### âœ… Adaptive Pencil Drawing Template
- **Template ID**: `pencil_drawing`
- **MCP Prompt**: Available via `pencil_drawing` prompt handler
- **Simple UX**: Users just say "I want to draw a cat" 
- **Auto-adaptation**: Skill level, technique, and complexity adapt based on subject

### âœ… Educational Drawing Templates
- `gesture_drawing` - Quick gestural sketches
- `basic_shapes_study` - Construction-based form studies  
- `contour_drawing` - Line-focused observation exercises
- `value_study` - Light and shadow practice

### âœ… Drawing Categories
- `drawing_educational` - Specialized drawing learning category
- Templates organized by educational intent vs. aesthetic mimicry

## What We've Built

**Core Value**: AI-generated images that look like pencil drawing exercises and references

**User Experience**:
```
User: "I want to draw a flower"
â†’ System: Generates image styled as a pencil drawing study of a flower
â†’ Result: Reference image for actual drawing practice
```

## Possible Future Additions

### ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Template Variety

#### **Figure Drawing Specialization**
- `figure_construction` - Structural approach to human figures
- `anatomy_study` - Focus on specific body parts and proportions
- `pose_reference` - Dynamic poses and gesture captures
- `portrait_fundamentals` - Face construction and features

#### **Subject-Specific Templates**
- `animal_studies` - Fur textures, animal proportions, movement
- `landscape_fundamentals` - Perspective, atmospheric depth, composition
- `still_life_setup` - Object relationships, lighting, form
- `botanical_drawing` - Plant structures, organic forms, detail work

#### **Technique-Focused Templates**
- `cross_hatching_study` - Shading technique demonstrations
- `blending_techniques` - Smooth gradation examples
- `line_weight_practice` - Varied line quality examples
- `texture_studies` - Surface quality references (wood, metal, fabric)

### ðŸ§  Smart Routing Enhancements

#### **Context-Aware Subject Detection**
```python
# Enhanced subject analysis
"I want to draw my pet dog" â†’ animal_studies template
"Quick 5-minute sketch" â†’ gesture_drawing template  
"Detailed portrait study" â†’ portrait_fundamentals template
"Practice basic forms" â†’ basic_shapes_study template
```

#### **Progressive Complexity Detection**
```python
# Conversation history analysis
User history: ["basic shapes", "simple objects"] 
Next request: "draw a person" â†’ intermediate complexity
Auto-route to: figure_construction vs. advanced portrait
```

#### **Time-Based Routing**
```python
# Session length detection from natural language
"Quick sketch" â†’ gesture_drawing (2-10 min focus)
"Study session" â†’ detailed template (30+ min focus)
"Warm-up drawing" â†’ basic_shapes_study (5-15 min focus)
```

### ðŸ“Š Advanced Adaptation Features

#### **Multi-Parameter Intelligence**
```python
# Current: Single auto-adaptation
skill_level="auto" â†’ basic adaptation

# Enhanced: Multi-factor analysis
context = {
    "subject_complexity": analyze_subject(subject),
    "user_vocabulary": analyze_language_level(prompt),
    "time_indicators": detect_session_length(prompt),
    "technique_hints": extract_technique_preferences(prompt)
}
â†’ Multi-dimensional adaptation
```

#### **Learning Path Integration**
```python
# Progression tracking (via MCP resources)
user_progress = {
    "completed_exercises": ["basic_shapes", "simple_objects"],
    "skill_areas": {"observation": "intermediate", "construction": "beginner"},
    "preferred_subjects": ["animals", "portraits"]
}
â†’ Personalized template selection
```

### ðŸŽ¨ Style Variation Expansion

#### **Drawing Medium Variations**
- `charcoal_study` - Broader, more expressive marks
- `graphite_precision` - Clean, precise technical drawing
- `ink_sketch` - Bold lines, limited tonal range
- `colored_pencil_study` - Limited color palette approach

#### **Artistic Approach Variations**
- `observational_drawing` - Focus on accurate representation
- `expressive_sketch` - Emphasis on feeling and energy
- `technical_illustration` - Precise, diagram-like approach
- `artistic_interpretation` - Creative, stylized approach

### ðŸ”— Integration Enhancements

#### **Template Chaining**
```python
# Automatic progression suggestions
After gesture_drawing â†’ suggest contour_drawing
After basic_shapes â†’ suggest simple_objects
After figure_construction â†’ suggest anatomy_study
```

#### **Resource Integration**
```python
# New MCP resources
"drawing-progress://user-skill-analysis"
"practice-history://completed-exercises"  
"learning-path://recommended-next"
"reference-library://subject-examples"
```

### ðŸŽ¯ UX Refinements

#### **Natural Language Processing**
```python
# Enhanced intent detection
"I struggle with proportions" â†’ focus_area="proportions"
"Need to work on shading" â†’ focus_area="light_shadow" 
"Quick warm-up sketch" â†’ session_length="quick"
"Detailed study session" â†’ session_length="extended"
```

#### **Smart Defaults**
```python
# Context-aware parameter selection
subject="cat" + user_history=beginner â†’ basic animal construction
subject="portrait" + time_indicator="quick" â†’ gesture_drawing approach
subject="landscape" + skill_indicator="advanced" â†’ complex composition
```
